# Things to know impending to your graduation

## Congratulations! 
I am exciting for you that you have done amazing works so far and you are about to see your fruit as a doctoral degree. There are a few things that are not clearly explained in guidebooks and webpages regarding to graduation, and hence I wrote this wiki page.

There are a couple of thesis information sessions at GT

To find deadlines regarding the dissertation, refer to the link below

Below are a couple of things that are not clearly explained in any of the materials. The information below is as of 2021, so please check whether they are not too outdated with graduate coordinators or related persons.

• Doctoral thesis credit is not a requirement
You would notice that there is a course named “Doctoral thesis”, which you can use to register the number of credits you want. However, the course is NOT a requirement for your graduation. If you want to use it, you have to ask Shebbie (Academic program manager in Psychology) to create a course with the name of Doby. Otherwise, you can simply use “Special problems” to register the credits you want.

• If you waive to register a semester, you are not eligible to be paid
You can waive to register a semester before your graduation if you only left a dissertation submission. However, once you get a waiver, you are not eligible to be paid through GRA/GTA (because you are not registered). Normally, students use this waiver in a case where they missed the deadline for thesis submission, and they need to start a new position (so that they are not affiliated to GT for a whole semester).

• The thesis submission deadline is bound to the commencement timing
While the school informs you that there’s a specific deadline for submitting your thesis, the deadline is really for scheduling your commencement. For instance, if the deadline for the thesis submission was April 30th for a Spring semester and if you submit your thesis before the deadline, then you would be able to attend the commencement at the end of the Spring semester. If you miss the deadline, then you can submit it anytime during the summer semester as you are ready, and you will attend the commencement at the end of the Fall semester.

If you miss the thesis submission deadline, your degree (diploma) will be conferred after 4-6 weeks. Meantime, you can ask for a letter for degree completion.
